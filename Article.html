This fall a Jacksonville-based nonprofit that connects top- performing athletes with underserved schools will use Google Glass to help build relationships between California-based Paralympian Lex Gillette and students across the country.

Through Glass, a device that works like a smartphone and is worn like a pair of glasses, the blind track and field athlete will give students first-person educational videos as he trains, competes and performs. In response, the students will describe to him what they are viewing and learning along the way.
"I'm excited to use Glass to share my perspective," said Gillette, a three-time U.S. Paralympic silver medalist and 2013 world champion. "This will give them a really amazing way to learn with me."

Classroom Champions was one of five nonprofits nationwide selected by Google to develop ideas using Web-connected Google Glass to enhance their work. Google received about 1,300 proposals. The winners receive a free pair of the glasses, a $25,000 grant and support from Google developers.

The Google Glass project is an expansion of what Classroom Champions has been doing with students in kindergarten through eighth grade since 2009.

The nonprofit was founded by bobsledder Steve Mesler, a three- time Olympian, world champion and 2010 Olympic gold medalist, and his sister, Leigh Mesler Parise, who has a doctorate in education and social policy.

Mesler is a Buffalo native who attended the University of Florida on a track scholarship and received a bachelor's degree in exercise and sport sciences in 2000. He lives in Calgary, but his last Florida address was in Jacksonville and that's where he wanted to base the nonprofit, he said.

"That's how much my Florida roots mean to me," he said.

The idea for Classroom Champions stemmed from his frustration with the brief visits he and other athletes made to schools.

"The actual impact [of the visits] was not terribly great," he said.

So he and Parise developed Classroom Champions, which uses regular video lessons and live video chats to build an ongoing mentoring relationship between athletes and students over a six- month period.

Each athlete adopts three to 10 classrooms per year and interacts with students several times a month. They talk about the hard work of training, goal setting, competition and perseverance. The nonprofit helps teachers incorporate the athletes' activities into their curricula, focusing on letter writing, reading, geography, math, technology, goal setting and leadership.

As students learn the athletes' full stories, they hopefully will be motivated to see their own potential.

"They could be doing big things, too," he said. "I was a kid just like them."

Also, students are being educated in the practical use of communications technology. Meanwhile, Classroom Champions staff surveys participating students and teachers to look for ways to improve the program.

The nonprofit grew from serving 193 students in 2009 to 3,501 to date, according to its website. Currently, 115 schools, 142 teachers and 41 Olympians and Paralympians are participating, including several Florida schools but none in the Jacksonville area.

Mesler said he knew the Google Glass project would be a "natural fit" as soon as he found about it.

"How amazing would that be, especially for Paralympians, to really show what their life is like?" he said. "We couldn't be more excited to work with Glass to enable athletes to teach kids how grit and determination can shape their future."Beth Reese Cravey: (904) 359-4109CLASSROOM CHAMPIONSTo donate, be a community sponsor, sign up a class or become an athlete mentor, or to get more information, call (877) 375-1996 or go to classroomchampions.org.
