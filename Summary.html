        <p>Students across the country will be able to connect and build relationships with California-based
        paralympian Lex Gillette using Google Glass. Through the Glass Lex will give students first person educational videos as he trains, competes and performs. For students will respond what he or she are viewing and learning along the way. "Im excited to use Glass to share my perspective," said Gillette."This will give them a really amazing way to learn with me." This Google Glass project, which is also known as the Classroom Champions, has been apart of elementary students since 2009. This nonprofit was founded by a 3 time olympian, world Champion, 2010 Gold medalist, Steve Mesler and his sister Leigh Mesler who is a Doctorate in education and social policy. His idea of this brilliant project was stemmed from personal visits with athletes at schools. And Each athlete adopts 3 to 10 classrooms per year and is a mentor to those for six months. Students will talk to the athlete about the athletes Hard work of training, goal setting, competition and perseverance the athlete goes through. As students listen and learn the athletes full stories, they will hopefull be motivated to see their own potential. Gillette states that "They could be doing big things, too" he said. "I was a kid just like them".</p>
